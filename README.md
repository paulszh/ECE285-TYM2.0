This is project FOO developed by team TYM2.0 composed of Zhouhang Shao, Yuming Qiao, Fengjunyan Li, Haoran Wang
Requirements
============
There is no extra package requirement to run the code in UCSD DSMLP
Code organization
=================
demo.ipynb -- Run a demo of our code (reproducing the result of our trained model)
model.h5 -- Already trained model, will be used in demo.ipynb
model.json -- Already trained model, will be used in demo.ipynb
logs.npy -- File used in training, will store training result of each epochs and use results in plot
dataset -- a folder contains our training and testing data. Note that Our data has already been stored in UCSD DSMLP.
