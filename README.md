## Description
This is project FOO developed by team TYM2.0 composed of Zhouhang Shao, Yuming Qiao, Fengjunyan Li, Haoran Wang
Requirements

## Extra Package:
There is no extra package requirement to run the code in UCSD DSMLP
## Code organization:
**blood_cell_classification_training.ipynb**: Contain all the code to train our models
**blood_cell_classification_demo.ipynb**: Run a demo of our code (reproducing the result of our trained model)
model.h5: Already trained model, will be used in blood_cell_classification_demo.ipynb.ipynb
model.json: Already trained model, will be used in blood_cell_classification_demo.ipynb.ipynb
logs.npy: File used in training, will store training result of each epochs and use results in plot
dataset: a folder contains our training and testing data. Note that Our data has already been stored in UCSD DSMLP. The training and testing files have been configured to directly load the data from the data folder on ieng6 server.
